<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

How To use App Goes Here.....


<!-- DATA STORAGE AND SAFETY -->
## Authentication

 Authenticating user-to-user chat is done using an object that stores user IDs along with their socket ID when they connect.
 This allows me to emit messages "to" a specific user ID using their socket ID.

## Data Storage And Safety

Everything that is stored to be used later is encrypted and secured while stored. This includes anything from password,email,travel forms, to all the locations from your trips. Decoding alogorithms are in places to bring back the stored data to be used
on the client side when asked by that specific user. I may have went a little overboard with the encryption even, but it was fun to learn and good practice! However, I may get rid of the encrypting of the locations from trips as that takes time and may not be needed since registered users can see these anyways.
